# HTTP_server
An HTTP server written in C intended for hosting static webpages.

It does not natively support TLS altough it can be implemented by using a TLS reverse proxy. You can also instead opt for not using TLS and instead run the webserver on a network such as tor or i2p where everything is already encrypted for you.
